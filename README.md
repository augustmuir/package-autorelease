- Automatically create a changelog with relevant commits for each release.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Follow these simple steps to set up and start using Package-AutoRelease:

1. Create a git repository with an npm package. You can use the command `npm init -y` to create a new npm package.
    - The name of the package must be in the format `@YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME`, for example: `@augustmuir/my-private-repo`.
2. Generate a Github Personal Access Token with `write:packages` permission [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
3. Authenticate your Github account with npm by running `npm login --scope=@OWNER --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`, where `@OWNER` is your Github username.
4. Install `standard-version` with `npm install -D standard-version@latest`.
5. Add the following script to your `package.json`:
```
"scripts": {
    "release": "standard-version && git push --follow-tags && npm publish"
}
```

## üöÄ Usage

Using Package-AutoRelease is as simple as:

1. Commit your changes to your branch as needed.
2. When you're ready to create a new release, run `npm run release` to generate a new release with a changelog.
3. You can use the package in other projects via `npm install @YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME` (replace github username/repo name).

That's it! With these simple steps, you can automate the versioning and releasing of your Github packages with just a few commands.
