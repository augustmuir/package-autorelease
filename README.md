## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Follow these simple steps to set up and start using Package-AutoRelease:

1. In your package folder if not already initialize npm `npm init -y`, create/add a Github repo, and name your package `@YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GTIHUB_REPO_NAME`.
```
npm init -y
```

```
// package.json
{
  "name": "@username/reponame", // ex: "@augustmuir/package-autorelease",
  ...
}
```
2. If not already authorized with Github & npm:
  - Generate a Github Personal Access with `write:packages` permission [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
  - Authenticate your Github account: `npm login --scope=@YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`.
3. Add `standard-version`
```
npm install -D standard-version@latest
```
4. Add the following script to your `package.json`:
```
"scripts": {
    "release": "standard-version && git push --follow-tags && npm publish"
}
```

## üöÄ Usage

Using Package-AutoRelease is as simple as:

1. Commit your changes to your branch as needed.
2. When you're ready to create a new release, run `npm run release` to generate a new release with a changelog.
3. You can use the package in other projects via `npm install @YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME` (replace github username/repo name).

That's it! With these simple steps, you can automate the versioning and releasing of your Github packages with just a few commands.
